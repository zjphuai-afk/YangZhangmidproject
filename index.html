Introduction to the Data

This dataset contains detailed records on 2,392 high school students with 15 variables. These variables include: StudentID, Age, Gender, Ethnicity, ParentalEducation, StudyTimeWeekly, Absences, Tutoring, ParentalSupport, Extracurricular activities, Sports participation, Music participation, Volunteering, GPA, and GradeClass. The dataset is well-suited for educational research, building predictive models, and conducting statistical analyses. Throughout this project, we use the dataset to answer our research questions by examining academic performance through multiple analytical approaches.

Research Question1:Does participation in tutoring programs improve academic performance?

Data Preparation

For this question, GPA was treated as a continuous outcome variable, and tutoring participation was coded as a binary variable (0 = no tutoring, 1 = tutoring). To make the results easier to interpret, the tutoring indicator was converted into a labeled factor. Since the dataset contained no missing values for these variables, no additional cleaning was required. This setup allows us to compare GPA across the two tutoring groups and also to extend the analysis using additional modeling.

Student_performance_data_$TutoringFactor <- factor(
Student_performance_data_$Tutoring,
levels = c(0, 1),
labels = c("No tutoring", "Tutoring")
)
Methodology: Independent Samples t-test

To find out whether tutoring is linked to better academic performance, we compare the average GPA of students who attended tutoring with those who did not. Because GPA is numerical and the two groups are independent, an independent-samples t-test is an appropriate method. The test checks whether the difference in mean GPA between the tutoring and non-tutoring groups is statistically meaningful.

# Mean GPA for each group

tapply(
Student_performance_data_$GPA,
Student_performance_data_$TutoringFactor,
mean
)
## No tutoring    Tutoring 
##    1.818968    2.108325
# Two-sample t-test

t_test_tutoring <- t.test(
GPA ~ TutoringFactor,
data = Student_performance_data_
)
t_test_tutoring
## 
##  Welch Two Sample t-test
## 
## data:  GPA by TutoringFactor
## t = -7.1725, df = 1366.6, p-value = 1.203e-12
## alternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group No tutoring and group Tutoring is not equal to 0
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  -0.3684970 -0.2102165
## sample estimates:
## mean in group No tutoring    mean in group Tutoring 
##                  1.818968                  2.108325
### Visualization


``` r
ggplot(
Student_performance_data_,
aes(x = TutoringFactor, y = GPA)
) +
geom_boxplot(fill = "lightblue") +
labs(
x = "Tutoring participation",
y = "GPA",
title = "GPA by Tutoring Participation"
)


Visualization Interpretation

The boxplot shows that students who attended tutoring generally have higher and more consistent GPAs, with a higher median compared to the non-tutoring group. The non-tutoring group also has more low GPA values, visually supporting the difference found in the t-test.

Modeling Analysis: Logistic Regression

To add a modeling component, GPA is further converted into a binary variable indicating whether a student achieved a “high GPA.” Students with GPA ≥ 3.0 are coded as 1 (High GPA), and students with GPA < 3.0 are coded as 0 (Not High GPA). A logistic regression model is then used to examine whether tutoring participation is associated with a higher chance of achieving a high GPA.

# Create binary HighGPA variable

Student_performance_data_$HighGPA <- ifelse(
Student_performance_data_$GPA >= 3.0, 1, 0
)

# Logistic regression model: High GPA ~ Tutoring

model_logit <- glm(
HighGPA ~ Tutoring,
data = Student_performance_data_,
family = binomial
)
summary(model_logit)
##

## glm(formula = HighGPA ~ Tutoring, family = binomial, data = Student_performance_data_)
##

## ---
## Signif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1
## 
## (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1)
## 
##     Null deviance: 1886.3  on 2391  degrees of freedom
## Residual deviance: 1845.7  on 2390  degrees of freedom
## AIC: 1849.7
## 
## Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4
Model Interpretation

In the logistic regression, the coefficient for Tutoring is positive, which means that students who attend tutoring have higher odds of achieving a high GPA compared to those who do not. Even though the overall proportion of high-GPA students is not very large, tutoring still shows a meaningful positive association in the model. This provides additional evidence, beyond the t-test, that tutoring is related to better academic outcomes.

Conclusion for Research Question 1

Across both the t-test and the logistic regression model, tutoring participation is consistently linked with stronger academic performance. Students who attend tutoring not only have higher average GPAs, but they are also more likely to reach a high GPA threshold (GPA ≥ 3.0). Although these results are based on observational data and cannot prove causality, they suggest that tutoring may be a helpful support for improving students’ grades.

Research Question2:Which Behavioral and non-behavioral factors most strong affect academic performance?

Data Prep

To analyze which factors most strongly affect academic performance, I first prepared the dataset by coding GPA into categorical letter grades, where D was coded as 1, C as 2, B as 3, and A as 4. This transformation allowed GPA to serve as a categorical outcome variable suitable for Chi‑squared testing. I then grouped the predictors into two categories: non‑behavioral and behavioral. Non‑behavioral factors included Gender, Ethnicity, and ParentalEducation, as these represent demographic and family background characteristics that students cannot directly control. Behavioral factors included Absences, Tutoring, Extracurricular activities, Sports, Music, Volunteering, and StudyTimeWeekly, since these reflect student choices, habits, and participation that can be modified. By structuring the data in this way, I was able to run Chi‑squared tests to examine whether the distribution of GPA categories differed significantly across behavioral and non‑behavioral variables, providing insight into which group of factors has the strongest association with academic performance.

Methodology

To understand which factors most strongly affect academic performance, I used a Chi‑squared model. A Chi-squared model is prefect for catagagorical data. and making informed comparisons. This approach tests whether categorical variables such as gender, ethnicity, and parental education (non‑behavioral) or absences, tutoring, extracurriculars, sports, music, volunteering, and study time (behavioral) are significantly associated with GPA categories. To explore the role of non‑behavioral factors, I examined how demographic characteristics and parental structure influence the distribution of GPA categories, highlighting background influences that may shape long‑term academic outcomes but are less directly actionable. To assess the impact of behavioral factors, I conducted Chi‑squared tests on variables such as absences, tutoring participation, extracurricular involvement, and study time. These behaviors represent choices and habits that students can modify, and the results reveal whether they are disproportionately associated with higher or lower GPA categories. This combination of analyses enables a clear comparison between background characteristics and student behaviors, helping to determine which factors most strongly contribute to academic performance and where interventions may be most effective.

Individual Variable Results

Focusing on what most strongly affects academic performance, above are the results from my Chi‑squared model. This analysis shows the significance of each variable in its relation to GPA categories (coded D=1, C=2, B=3, A=4). The distribution of GPA outcomes across the dataset reveals that 848 students fell into category D, 838 into C, 629 into B, and only 77 into A, highlighting that the majority of students are clustered in the lower performance ranges. The Chi‑squared test illuminates that Absences are the most significant behavioral factor, with a test statistic of χ² = 3164.4 (the larger the number, the stronger the difference between observed and expected), df = 87 (number of comparisons), and p < 2.2e‑16 (proof of statistical significance). This extremely small p‑value indicates a very strong association between attendance and GPA outcomes, which logically makes sense: students who miss more classes are disproportionately represented in lower GPA categories. Surprisingly, time spent studying does not have a meaningful relationship with GPA, with a p‑value of 0.48. This suggests that reported study hours alone do not reliably predict performance outcomes in this dataset. Looking at non‑behavioral factors individually shows a different picture. ParentalEducation produced a test statistic of χ² = 13.951, df = 12, p = 0.3038, which is not significant. Similarly, Gender (χ² = 0.711, df = 3, p = 0.8706) and Ethnicity (χ² = 4.834, df = 9, p = 0.8486) did not show meaningful associations with GPA categories. This indicates that demographic background variables do not directly explain differences in academic performance within this dataset and have a very low effect on overall student performance.

Behavioral Variable vs Non Behavioral Results

To test all behavioral variables together, I created a BehavioralIndex. This index combines the behavior variables into one bundle. The association remains highly significant (χ² = 656.36, df = 3, p < 2.2e‑16), confirming that behaviors such as study time, tutoring, and extracurricular involvement collectively play a major role in shaping academic success. The logical explanation here is that the BehavioralIndex captures student choices and habits that directly influence learning opportunities. For example, attending class regularly, participating in tutoring, and engaging in extracurriculars all increase exposure to academic material and build discipline. When combined, these behaviors create a strong cumulative effect on GPA outcomes, which is why the index shows such a powerful association. By contrast, the NonBehavioralIndex, which combines parental education, gender, and ethnicity, shows no meaningful association with GPA outcomes. The logic here is that while these background factors may shape long‑term opportunities, they are not directly modifiable by the student and do not explain short‑term differences in GPA within this dataset. In other words, demographic variables provide context but do not drive immediate academic performance the way behaviors do.

Research Question3:How Do extracurricular activites affect academic perforce?

Methodology

To investigate how extracurricular activities affect academic performance, I constructed a linear regression model with GPA as a continuous outcome variable. Treating GPA continuously rather than categorically allows the model to estimate the amount of change in GPA associated with each activity, rather than simply testing whether distributions differ. This provides insight into both the size and direction of effects. The predictors included four extracurricular variables coded from the dataset that I used are Extracurricular(all encompassing), Sports involvement, Music participation, and Volunteering By regressing GPA on these activities, the model calculates the average effect size of each extracurricular factor while also testing for statistical significance. The regression output provides summary statistics that give us inighits into variable relationships. Specicaly, coefficients (estimates), standard errors, t‑values, and p‑values for each predictor, along with overall model fit statistics (R², adjusted R², F‑statistic).

Results

The regression model examining extracurricular activities shows how participation in sports, music, volunteering, and general extracurricular involvement affects GPA as a continuous outcome. The overall model is statistically significant, with an F‑statistic of 11 on 4 and 2,387 degrees of freedom and a p‑value of 7.7e‑09. However, the explanatory power is modest, with an R² of 0.0181 and an adjusted R² of 0.0165, meaning that extracurriculars account for only about 1.8% of the variance in GPA. Despite the limited variance explained, the coefficients highlight meaningful differences across activities. Students who participate in extracurriculars overall show an average GPA increase of +0.18 points (p < 2e‑06), while sports involvement adds +0.12 GPA points (p = 0.0029) and music participation contributes +0.17 GPA points (p = 0.00019). Volunteering, by contrast, shows no measurable effect, with a coefficient of +0.007 and a p‑value of 0.889. These results suggest that structured extracurriculars such as sports and music, which require discipline, practice, and consistent engagement, are positively associated with GPA. Volunteering, often irregular and varied in intensity, does not display the same measurable relationship. The residual standard error of 0.9076 indicates that while extracurriculars contribute positively, most of the variation in GPA is explained by other factors such as attendance or study habitts, as noted on in the Chai Squared model. Overall, the analysis confirms that extracurricular activities enrich academic performance, but their overall impact is modest compared to core behavioral predictors.
